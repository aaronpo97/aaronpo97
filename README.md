# About Me
Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a software developer based in London, ON, Canada. 

I am student at Fanshawe College studying Computer Programming and Analysis, and an alumnus of Western University having studied music and philosophy.

##  Skills

I bring the following strengths to every team and project:

- Rapid learning and application of new technologies
- Strong time management and prioritization
- Critical thinking and decision-making
- Self-motivation and a proactive attitude
- Commitment to continuous learning
- Flexibility in adapting to changing requirements

##  Interests

I thrive on exploring new technologies and creating applications that are both functional and visually compelling. My background in the arts enhances my approach to design and user experience.

Outside of development, I enjoy cooking, gardening, biking, and watching professional wrestling. I’m also deeply interested in analytic philosophy—especially its intersections with computer science. Thinkers like Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein continue to inspire me in my exploration of logic, language, and computation.
