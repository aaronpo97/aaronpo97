##  Interests

I thrive on exploring new technologies and creating applications that are both functional and visually compelling. My background in the arts enhances my approach to design and user experience.

Outside of development, I enjoy cooking, gardening, biking, and watching professional wrestling. I’m also deeply interested in analytic philosophy—especially its intersections with computer science. Thinkers like Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein continue to inspire me in my exploration of logic, language, and computation.
